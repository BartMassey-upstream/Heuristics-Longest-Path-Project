7/14 Update:

Today I worked on 2 things:

    1. Coding an algorithm utilizing heuristics that I thought I could solve the problem
    2. Researchng more about heuristics and graph theory in general

For the coding side of things. I had a couple of ideas for the code I had done yesterday. 
I wrote a cleaner and commented version of that idea. However, it turns out that the code is as accurate as I had hoped. 
From my debugging and testing, I have deduced that the problem is my code always takes the lower number vertex if two vertices have the same "potential" destination points. 
If I were to try and fix this, it would very likely become a recursive function with what I have in mind. I'll have to more testing on that.

For research, I search online about the longest path of an undirected, unweighted graph and found very little as it is an NP-hard problem. 
However, there were people talking about longest path on unweighted trees, which I remember Bart talking about in the first meeting we had. 
I also saw people were discussing both DFS and BFS so i wonder if those can somehow be used on undirected, unweighted graphs in general.
