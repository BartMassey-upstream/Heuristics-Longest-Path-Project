# Heuristics-Longest-Path-Project
Justin Xie, Bart Massey, Cassaundra Smith 2022

# About the Project
This project aims to use heuristics in the longest path problem in graph theory

# In this Repository
Currently, in this repository, there is:
1. Random graph generation
a. Programs for generating random, unweighted graphs
b. Benchmarking programs for the random graph generators
2. Longest Path Problem
a. A brute-force algorithm for solving the longest path problem
b. A heuristic that uses the greedy principle to find the longest path
c. A heuristic based on pruning a graph into a tree and applying Dijkstra's algorithm to find the longest path
d. Benchmarking for the longest path algorithm and heuristics
