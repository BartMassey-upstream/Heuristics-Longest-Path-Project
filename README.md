# Heuristics-Longest-Path-Project
Justin Xie, Bart Massey, Cassaundra Smith 2022

## About the Project
This project aims to use heuristics in the longest simple path problem

## In this Repository
Currently, in this repository, there are algorithms for generating random, unweighted graph (connected and unconnected). There are also runtime benchmarking programs for these algorithms.

There is also a brute-force algorithm and two heuristics for tackling the longest path problem. one heuristic uses the greedy principle and the other prunes a graph into a tree before applying Dijkstra's algorithm. The repository also contains benchmarking data for the longest path algorithm and heuristics
